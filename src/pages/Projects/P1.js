                    <h2 className="fw-bold fs-5">Project Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>In this course students were required to submit a research proposal on any viable topic. This project was a group project and was the final submission of the course. As the method of the research, we selected a content analysis method after discussing with the course teacher. The goal of this course was to learn how to write a research proposal on any topic. This was the very first group project that has allowed me to understand our strengths and limitations. It was a group project so it was the very first project that allowed me to learn about team working and helped us to enhance our communication skills.</p>

                    <h2 className="fw-bold fs-5">Project Justification: </h2>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to learn how to write a research proposal. As we were new to this subject, we wanted to explore its different fields to know what could help us more. We wanted to convey a content analysis research method to understand in our liberation war films, which one was portrayed more, the warfare or the war politics. I specifically wanted to work on this topic because it opens up a new section of knowing. Earlier movies were used as a tool of propaganda. During the World War 2, the Nazis used movies to spread misinformation about Nazi so that people would support them. It is one of the strongest communication tools that allows people to come as one. Which is why I wanted to explore which one was portrayed more in our film, the warfare or the politics behind the war. </p>

                    <h2 className='text-center fw-bold fs-5'>SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>Communication through mass media is understood as mass communication. Mass communication means that employing a style of mass media to deliver messages instantly to an outsized cluster of individuals. Film is a genre of how a message can be shared to mass people and this is how Bangladeshi filmmakers shared first-hand experience about the Liberation War of Bangladesh among the mass audience. Both of his films <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> and <i>Sangram</i> represent his liberation war experience.</p>

                    <p>In 1971, The Liberation War of Bangladesh was a serious issue and got international attention. Chashi Nazrul Islams film got more concern as most of the actors of both of the films took active part in the liberation war too. <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> represents the struggle of freedom fighters, their families and surroundings. <i>Sangram</i> represents the struggle of Bengali Army officers against the West Pakistani Army.</p>

                    <p>In the literature review section, the researchers have tried to analyze which one was shown more clearly, warfare or war politics in these films, and the ultimate theory behind those films as well as in this study. There is nothing made without purpose. These said films have huge things to say about our warfare and war politics. Filmmaker uses the reflective approach to define the liberation war history and extremism.</p>
                    While reviewing literature, the researchers also realized that there is a lack of research in Bangladesh regarding the warfare, war politics and issues based on these said films. The present study will fill up that a bit.

                    <h2 className='fs-5 fw-bold mt-5'>CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION</h2>

                    <h3 className='fs-6 mt-3'><b>Abstract:</b></h3>
                    <p>From the early 1900’s film has become a standard medium to entertain people. Since film is the most pervasive form of communication and entertainment(Goldsmith and Lealand, 2010), it is a way to communicate with certain audiences by presenting or representing certain communities, ideas or thoughts. This paper of our describes a couple of films content analysis of Bangladeshi filmmaker Chashi Nazrul Islam’s films <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> and <i>Sangram</i>. The objective of this paper is to look at questions like: How warfare were shown in the war films of Bangladesh? Is the warfare shown completely in the films? Do they portray reality? There is nothing without any motive. Here the study is prepared to discuss the focused content in these films and what the filmmaker tries to communicate with whom, how and why. The constructionist approach to represent the warfare and war politics, and reasons behind making such films are the matter of discussion in this study.</p>

                    <p><b>1. Background of the Study</b></p>
                    <p>Communication through mass media is understood as mass communication. Mass communication means that employing a style of mass media to deliver messages instantly to an outsized cluster of individuals. Mass media these days has become one among the popular media because it focuses on the distinguished stories which are able to be of interest to the final public audiences. It's a large business as many folks everywhere on the planet have faith in it for a few purposes or the opposite. Mass media these days has become one among the foremost essential elements of human societies. Understanding mass media sometimes could be a method of understanding a population and its culture. Another footprint within the sand of communication is once the invention of films. Cinema or film a style of Mass Media has become a strong tool since the day it had been introduced to the planet. Cinematographics derived from the Greek acceptance movement and writing was made-up by the Lumiere Brothers. In 1929, The Lights of the latest dynasty, the primary talking film, was screened. Cinema came to the Republic of India in 1986, once the film Pundalik directed by R.G. Torney and N.C. Chitra was free in eighteenth might.</p>
                    <p>The movie industry has had a big space for the past years and has caused plenty of changes within the society.</p>
                    <p>Film is a visual alternative to literature that mirrors our experience of modern life. We have a unique means of preserving the historic past, as well as looking forward, towards an uncertain future. The idea of a film sometimes can have such an enormous impact on people can be difficult for some, however this same impact can also be a great tool when used properly and for the right reason. In the same way, film owns the power to represent the real world. As the title of Erich Auerbach suggests, mimicry of the ‘real world’ has preoccupied aesthetics(Goldsmith and Lealand, 2010). The starting was in early nineteenth century by the invention of technology of</p>

                    <p>photography. It happened not simply because the images looked like what they were referring to, but because the invention of technology was deemed to make the representation objective by avoiding the subjectivity of an individual artist(Goldsmith and Lealand, 2010).</p>
                    <p>Not only that, film can also represent reality in a different way. Archetypes, derived from the ideas of Carl Jung are Broad categories that are meant to be applicable to all cultures; for example, the ‘mother’ or ‘wise old man’. Stereotypes on the other hand are more culturally specific. Nick Lacey here added, a small amount of information enables audiences to quickly categorize a character (Lacey, 2005). Richard Dyer also suggested that, Stereotypes are both an ‘ordering process’ and a ‘short cut to meaning’. For example, he quotes Tessa Perkins to demonstrate how a woman with blonde hair, voluptuous figure and pouting expression offers many connotations: “it refers immediately to her sex, which refers to her status in society, her relationship to men, her inability to behave or think rationally, and so on. In short it implies knowledge of a complex social structure(Lacey, 2005). Here a small amount of information enables audiences to quickly categorize a character. These categories have distinct boundaries and so there is little or no ambiguity. Clearly it is ridiculous to assess a person’s intelligence from her hair color, and this conception of blonde women illustrates how stereotypes articulate ideological values (Lacey, 2005).</p>
                    <p>A film not only can represent stereotypical thoughts, it also represents real events or stories like history. All history is a representation of past events; it is obviously impossible to experience the events as they happened, so we are left with versions of events that we understand in a particular fashion (Goldsmith and Lealand, 2010). A filmmaker gives the story a shape according to his/her representation ideas and skills. Film is a way to communicate with people and here the platform is huge.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>2. History of Bangladeshi Film</b></p>
                    <i>Mukh O Mukhosh</i> was the first ever feature film in the Bangladeshi film industry. In 1953, director Abdul Jabbar Khan started working on the film Mukh O Mukhosh under the banner of ‘Iqbal Films’. In the 1960s, one of the prominent directors of East Bengal was Zahir Raihan. Some of his notable works include <i>Kokhono Asheni, Kancher Deyal, Dui Bhai, Let There be Light,</i> and <i>Jibon Theke Neya</i>. In 1971 he made a documentary on the Bangladesh Liberation War, Stop Genocide, which was one of the first internationally acclaimed films of Bangladesh. After the liberation war, Chashi Nazrul Islam came with a new hope in film industry through his film <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> in 1972. Chashi Nazrul Islam (1941-2015) was a Bangladeshi independent filmmaker. He is a pioneer of the independent film movement of Bangladesh. Being an independent filmmaker is not easy. According to Haq and Balraj, independent films tend to be unpopular with mainstream audiences because of their relatively complex form and content, but it is important to study the independent cinema of Bangladesh for two major reasons; these films wins awards in the international film festival circuit and they have become the backbone of national cinema of Bangladesh, introducing fresh talent, leading directors and cinematographers, to the wider industry(Shoesmith and Genilo, 2013). <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i>  was his first film and it was at the starting of Chashi Nazrul Islam’s career. This study is analyzing his full-length feature films- <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> (1972) and <i>Sangram</i> (1974). <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> is the first film about the Liberation War of Bangladesh. And It was released right after the year of our liberation.

                    <p><b>3. Research Objectives:</b></p>
                    <p>To identify, in between warfare and war politics, which one is shown most in our Liberation war films of Bangladesh. And if it’s shown completely.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>4. Research Questions:</b></p>
                    <p>●	    How were Warfare shown in the war films of Bangladesh? <br />
                    ●	    Is the warfare shown completely in these films? <br />
                    ●	    Does the shown war politics portray the reality?</p>

                    <p><b>5. Significance of the research:</b></p>
                    <p>This study will help others to think deeply about the Liberation war of Bangladesh. To get clear view of warfare and war politics in Chashi Nazrul Islam’s films as well as Bangladeshi film media, this piece of study will be helpful. It’ll be helpful to others, who want to make films about our liberation war and the data collected by this study can be used by other researchers.</p>
                    <p><b>6. Scopes and Limitations of the study:</b></p>
                    <p>Being a student of the Media Studies and Journalism Department, analyzing the said films would not be difficult for the researcher. But time is a crucial factor for this study as there is a limitation of time to finish writing according to the semester’ course schedule. On the other hand, interviewing makers of the said films could be more supportive for the justification of this study. However, as Chashi Nazrul Islam had died of liver cancer at the Labaid Hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh on 11 January 2015, so it is no longer possible to get the filmmaker’s valuable insights which could make this study richer in quality.</p>

                    <h2 className="fs-5 fw-bold">CHAPTER II</h2>
                    <p><b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p>
                    <p>This chapter attempts to review the existing literature associated with the topic. This literature review covers the credibility of this thesis argument as it analyzes some text books, journal articles, and documents in the field of film, representation, madrasa students, teachers and mass media. Significantly, this study also will talk about the relation of all the above and why studying them is important.</p>
                    <p><b>1. Warfare and War Politics in Literature (Novel):</b></p>
                    <p>The book, ‘Muldhara 71’ by Maidul Hasan discussed thoroughly about the domestic and international politics, just before and during 1971, our liberation war. The author brought our domestic policy as well as our thereafter political situation. On the other hand, the author Major Rafiqul Islam PSC, in his book, Ekattorer Muktijuddho Egaroti Sectorer Bijoy Kahini, brought the paean of different kind of war in all the eleven sectors of Bangladesh. Mainly these two books cover an area of warfare and war politics. Where, Major Rafiqul Islam PSC covered different kind of warfare including air-navy-infantry. And Maidul Hasan brought the domestic and political issues of thereafter situations.</p>
                    <p><b>2. Facts behind Such Films:</b></p>
                    <p>Since Chashi Nazrul Islam took active part in the liberation war, through his films, he shares his childhood experiences here. He represents the ideas in his work in a mannered way. He supported the freedom fighters and showed their family crisis during the liberation war. His film <i>Sangram</i> shows the political crisis among Bengali Army Officers. Chashi Nazrul Islam’s films are nothing but his experiences and opinions. Any of social or religious issues was not important for Chashi Nazrul Islam. He only tried to work with full concentration on those issues that excite his understanding. He expresses his personal vision in his films rather than someone’s notion of box- office success. The reflection of his understanding is clear in his films as he represents the ideas there. Chashi Nazrul Islam said that during the liberation war, he always thought and dreamt of making films about the war. And right after the year war ended, he entered into the film industry with <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i>.</p>
                    <p>Well, some related literature more or less flourished by Raju’s writing as he talks more about Bangladesh cinema and national identity (Raju, 2015). He identifies the tension between and within the national and the transnational of this Asian cinema, also he deconstructs the nation-building discourse of the Bangladeshi state and its relationship with the film industry. He adds more on his another chapter that demonstrates how Bangladeshi art cinema, a national- cultural institution developed in a post-colonial nation-space in South Asia and addressed to a global audience.</p>
                    The identity crisis is more broadly discussed in his films using the conflict of Muslims and Hindus. There is no confusion that the film represents Chashi Nazrul Islam’s war life experience. But there are controversies about realist representation. As Dudley Andrew says:

                    <i>“The cinema reproduces identifiable parts of our world by framing, focusing and juxtaposing aspects of the visible in ‘acceptable’ ways (Andrew, 1984)”.</i>
                    <p>Realist representation Andrew more says:</p>

                    <i>“Realism in the cinema is driven by a desire to make the audience ignore the process of signification and to grasp directly the film’s plot or intrigue; for most film viewers, the plot is precisely and fully what a film represents (Andrew, 1984)”.</i>
                    <p>Whatever Andrew said, Hall attaches most worth to the hypothesis. According to him, a conceptual map is shared in Chashi Nazrul Islam’s films.</p>
<br />
                    <i>“A shared conceptual map is not enough. We must also be able to represent or exchange meanings and concepts, and we can only do that when we also have access to a shared language” (Hall and Open University, 1997).</i>
<br />
                    <p>Those particular characteristics of freedom fighters and their families in Chashi Nazrul Islam’s films share the extremist concept and ideologies about the narratives. How a filmmaker shows the narratives is sharing the particular interpretation of them to the outer world. The shared ideas and languages establish a specific concept of radical thought about the Bangladesh Liberation War as this represents the country as well. To define representation more widely Hall added:</p>
                    <i>“In the reflective approach, meaning is thought to lie in the object, person, idea or event in the real world, and language functions like a mirror, reflecting the true meaning as it already exists in the world”(Hall and Open University, 1997).</i>
                    <p>Meaning is not inherent in the characters or things in these films, meaning is constructed and produced. Since Chashi Nazrul Islam dealt with realist representation (Andrew, 1984), it can be</p>

                    <p>considered as Halls ‘mimetic’. The theory which says that language works by simply reflecting or imitating the truth that is already there and fixed in the world, is sometimes called 'mimetic'. The freedom fighter and the army officers in said films simply represents Tareque Masud’s thoughts through a dramatic way.</p>
                    <p><b>3. Study Framework:</b></p>
                    <p>Previous studies have shown no confusion that <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> represents Chashi Nazrul Islam’s war experiences but when he worked with same issues like the crisis among Bengali army officers during the war in <i>Sangram</i> it is a fact. As far as the researcher knows, no previous research has investigated the warfare and war politics profile of our liberation war films and the motivation behind making such characters in said films. Previous studies are limited to complete Chashi Nazrul Islam’s understanding through such contents in his films.</p>
                    <p>This piece of study will deal with the facts that motivated Chashi Nazrul Islam to create characters in his films. His own writing and interviews are enough to build a transparent idea about his motivation. Other literature will help to demonstrate the said characters according to war veteran’s demographic and psychographic profile. Hall’s representation theory is chosen to help conceptual theory.</p>
<br />
      <p>              These facts will share the knowledge about the actual role of warfare in his films. Warfare is not only a content in said films, they belong to a particular group from society. During these days, it is more important to work on them. As there is no discussion or controversies about warfare in Chashi Nazrul Islam’s films, to understand filmmaker more and the said characters, this piece of study will contribute more than the previous discussed literatures. His films discloses the facts about religious dogma, liberation war, identity crisis, terrorism and relevant. But no past literature elaborated them in detail. This research will complete the knowledge gap here by sharing the unveiled parts of these said films and characters.</p>
<br />
                    <h2 className='fs-4'><b>CHAPTER III</b></h2>
                    <p><b>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</b></p>
                    <p><b>1. Research Design and Methods</b></p>
                    <p>The aim of the researcher is to get insights about those factors hidden behind Chashi Nazrul Islam’s films focused on warfare and war politics. This chapter presents the research design of the study. It describes the research method, data gathering process, the sampling techniques, the instruments, data analytical process, etc.</p>
                    <p><b>1.1.Research Design</b></p>
                    <p>This research looks for explanations of Chashi Nazrul Islam’s incentive for making such said films and said characteristics, so the researcher has considered to apply the qualitative approach, in particular- case study approach, for this study which will help her to explain her research question. As the study focuses on the films <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> and <i>Sangram</i> by Chashi Nazrul Islam, here qualitative approach is more appropriate than quantitative approach. Qualitative research used to provide a complete, detailed description of the research topic. It is usually more</p>
<br />
                    <p>exploratory in nature. On the other hand, quantitative research focuses more in counting and classifying features and constructing statistical models and figures to explain what is observed. For this research topic, researchers need to understand filmmaker’s ideas and perception concerning warfare and war politics and the way he represented the characters in his films.</p>
                    <p>Qualitative Approach will help to open up new possibilities for understanding that might otherwise go unutilized.</p>

                    <p><b>2.              Research Method</b></p>
                    <p>The following data gathering methods will be used in the study:</p>
                    <p><b>1.     Content Analysis</b></p>
                    <p>Content Analysis will be used to get the understanding of Chashi Nazrul Islam and his film’s characteristics. His representation will be analyzed because there is nothing without any purpose and as well as it is confirmed that the character Parvez from <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> film represents the filmmaker’s war experience</p>
                    <p>Content Analysis is defined by Aktaruzzaman (2011) as “Content Analysis is commonly prescribed as analysis of existing documents such as magazines, newspapers, books, and Internet”. Following the objectives and to answer the research questions properly, content analysis will be the suitable method. Films are content here for the researcher and the approach is qualitative. Researcher here will work with the film characteristics, their demographic and psychographic characteristics and more about the filmmaker. To describe the films according to research objectives content analysis is more appropriate from other methods.</p>
                    <p><b>2.            Population and Sampling</b></p>
                    <p><b>1.    Sampling</b></p>
                    <p>For this study, non-probability purposive sampling is more appropriate. As the topic already sets two variables with it such as firstly, Chashi Nazrul Islam’s Films and secondly, warfare and war politics, purposive sampling is the perfect way to follow. The films <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> and <i>Sangram</i> are the samples for this study.</p>
                    <p><b>3.            Research Instrument</b></p>
                    <p>This present study will follow a specific research instrument, namely coding sheet in its qualitative analytical procedure.</p>
                    <p><b>1. Coding Sheet</b></p>
                    <p>Coding process involves the recognition of an important moment and encoding it (seeing it as something) prior to the process of interpretation (Boyatzis, 1998). A “good code” is one that captures the qualitative richness of the phenomenon. “Coding is how you define what the data you are analyzing are about. It involves identifying and recording one or more passages of text or other data items such as the parts of pictures that, in some sense, exemplify the same theoretical or descriptive data” (Gibbs 2007: 38). Once the data is ready for content analysis, a coding sheet will be prepared. With the help of that coding sheet researcher will collect qualitative information by analyzing the contents- The Clay Bird and Runway films by Tareque Masud.</p>
                    <p><b>4.            Data Gathering Process</b></p>
                    <p>For gathering data, researchers will watch the films thoroughly from Youtube in laptop. If needed, the film DVDs will be collected for this content analysis and data gathering process.A Coding Sheet will be used to gather data for content analysis by analyzing both films <i>Ora Egaro Jon</i> and <i>Sangram</i> by Chashi Nazrul Islam.</p>
                    <p><b>5.            Data Analysis Procedure</b></p>
                    <p>Researchers will analyze found data by using thematic analysis method. “Thematic analysis is a process to be used with qualitative information. It is not another qualitative method but a process that can be used with most, if not all, qualitative methods and that allows for the translation of qualitative information into quantitative data, if that is desired by the researcher” (Boyatzis, 1998).</p>

      <p><b>              Self-Reflection (Learnings and Outcomes):</b></p>
                    <p>This was the first project in university and it was my first step to learning how to work in a team as well. I also learned many things from this project. Research papers are a very important part of academia. A proper research proposal is inevitable to write a research paper. I learned about different research methods and gained communication and writing qualities from this project. As this was the very first group project, we were able to learn about being a team member, leadership qualities and it helped us to be a better communicator. This project helped me to be more collaborative as I constantly had to collaborate with my other group members and keep them aligned with the whole process. It also helped me to be a better leader.</p>
