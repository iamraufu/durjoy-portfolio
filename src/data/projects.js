We wanted to convey a content analysis research method to understand in our liberation war films, which one was portrayed more, the warfare or the war politics. I specifically wanted to work on this topic because it opens up a new section of knowing. Earlier movies were used as a tool of propaganda. During the World War 2, the Nazis used movies to spread misinformation about Nazi so that people would support them. It is one of the strongest communication tools that allows people to come as one. Which is why I wanted to explore which one was portrayed more in our film, the warfare or the politics behind the war. ",
